# CONKY

## üõ†Ô∏è About
Conky is a system monitor that displays any information on the desktop.    
- (CPU, RAM, Swap, Disk Space, Temperature, Top Process, Upload, Download, etc.)    
It is an extremely configurable utility, however, configuration is done by editing configuration files.    
Some may find it discouraging at first, but there is nothing to worry about. You will eventually love it :D.    

‚úÖ Tested on Manjaro/Arch Linux. May work with other KDE-Wayland setups.
