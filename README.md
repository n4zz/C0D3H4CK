# CONKY

## 🛠️ About
Conky is a system monitor that displays any information on the desktop.    
- CPU
- RAM
- Swap
- Disk Space
- Temperature
- Top Process
- Upload, Download, etc.

It is an extremely configurable utility, however, configuration is done by editing configuration files.    
Some may find it discouraging at first, but there is nothing to worry about. You will eventually love it :D.    

✅ Tested on Manjaro/Arch Linux. You can find conky for x11 at the link below, where they work great.     
I'm currently using Wayland, where I'm having problems, mainly with displaying images and icons.    

You can find my other Conky configurations. [here](https://codehack.cz/conky.html#gsc.tab=0)
